# BiocFrame - Bioconductor-like data frames

This package implements the BiocFrame class, a Bioconductor-friendly alternative to Pandas DataFrame. The main advantage is that the BiocFrame makes no assumption on the types of the columns - as long as an object has a length (`__len__`) and slicing methods (`__getitem__`), it can be used inside a `BiocFrame`. This allows us to accept arbitrarily complex objects as columns, which is often the case in Bioconductor objects.

## Installation

Package is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/biocframe/)

```bash
pip install biocframe
```
