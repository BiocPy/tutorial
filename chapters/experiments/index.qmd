## Represent experimental data

BiocPy provides (currently) three classes to represented experimental data. This includes

- `SummarizedExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SummarizedExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SummarizedExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)): Container class to represent genomic experiments, following Bioconductor's [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html).
- `SingleCellExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SingleCellExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SingleCellExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html)): Container class to represent single-cell experiments; follows Bioconductorâ€™s [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html).
- `MultiAssayExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/MultiAssayExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/MultiAssayExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)): Container class to represent multiple experiments and assays performed over a set of samples. follows Bioconductor's [MAE R/Bioc Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html).
