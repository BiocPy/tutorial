## Represent experimental data

BiocPy provides (currently) three classes to represented experimental data. This includes

- `SummarizedExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SummarizedExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SummarizedExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)): Container class to represent genomic experiments, following Bioconductor's [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html).
- `SingleCellExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SingleCellExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SingleCellExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html)): Container class to represent single-cell experiments; follows Bioconductorâ€™s [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html).
- `MultiAssayExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/MultiAssayExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/MultiAssayExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)): Container class to represent multiple experiments and assays performed over a set of samples. follows Bioconductor's [MAE R/Bioc Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html).

## Install packages

The [biocpy](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocPy) package serves as a convenient wrapper that installs all the core packages within the ecosystem.

```bash
pip install biocpy
```

Alternatively, you can install specific packages as required. For example:

```bash
pip install summarizedexperiment # <package-name>
```

## Update packages

To update packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -U summarizedexperiment # or <package-name>
```
