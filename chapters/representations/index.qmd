# The basics

BiocPy implements essential foundational data structures that serve as the building blocks for extensive and complex representations. This includes the [BiocFrame package](./biocframe.qmd) providing a Bioconductor-like data frame class, and the [GenomicRanges package](./genomic_ranges.qmd) to aid in representing genomic regions and facilitating analysis. The [BiocUtils](./atomics.qmd) package provides many atomic data type classes, defines generics and efficiently manages most common operations across these packages.

## Install packages

The [biocpy](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocPy) package serves as a convenient wrapper that installs all the core packages within the ecosystem.

```bash
pip install biocpy
```

Alternatively, you can install specific packages as required. For example:

```bash
pip install biocframe # <package-name>
```

## Update packages

To update packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -U biocframe # or <package-name>
```
