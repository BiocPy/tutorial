# The basics

All packages in the `BiocPy` ecosystem are released on Python's package registry - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).


The [biocpy](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocPy) package serves as a convenient wrapper that installs all the core packages within the ecosystem.

```bash
pip install biocpy
```

Alternatively, you can install specific packages as required. For example:

```bash
pip install summarizedexperiment # <package-name>
```

# Update packages

To update packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -U biocpy # or <package-name>
```
