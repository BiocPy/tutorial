# Welcome {.unnumbered}

***[BiocPy](https://github.com/BiocPy) is an effort to bring core data structures and representations from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) to Python.***

# Packages in `BiocPy` {#sec-core-pkgs}

Currently, the following **core** representations are implemented in Python

- `BiocUtils` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocUtils), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/BiocUtils/)): Common utilities for use across packages, mostly to mimic convenient aspects of base R.
- `BiocFrame` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocFrame), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/BiocFrame/)): Bioconductor-like dataframes in Python.
- `IRanges` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/IRanges), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/IRanges/)): Python implementation of the IRanges package to support interval arithmetic.
- `GenomicRanges` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/GenomicRanges), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/GenomicRanges/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html)): Container class to represent genomic locations and support genomic analysis. Similar to Bioconductor's [GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html).
- `SummarizedExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SummarizedExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SummarizedExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)): Container class to represent genomic experiments, following Bioconductor's [SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html).
- `SingleCellExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/SingleCellExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/SingleCellExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html)): Container class to represent single-cell experiments; follows Bioconductorâ€™s [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html).
- `MultiAssayExperiment` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/MultiAssayExperiment), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/MultiAssayExperiment/), [BioC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)): Container class to represent multiple experiments and assays performed over a set of samples. follows Bioconductor's [MAE R/Bioc Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html).

**Analysis packages**

- `scranpy`([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/scranpy), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/scranpy/)): Python bindings to the single-cell analysis methods from libscran and related C++ libraries.
- `singler`([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/singler), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/singler/)): Python bindings to the singleR algorithm to annotate cell types from known references.

**Utility packages**

- `rds2py` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/rds2py), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/rds2py/)): Parse, extract and create Python representations for datasets stored in RDS files. Currently supports Bioconductor's `SummarizedExperiment` and `SingleCellExperiment` objects.
- `mopsy` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/mopsy), [Docs](https://biocpy.github.io/mopsy/)): Convenience library to perform row/column operations over numpy and scipy matrices. Provides an interface similar to base R matrix methods/MatrixStats methods.
- `pyBiocFileCache` ([GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy/pyBiocFileCache), [Docs](https://pypi.org/project/pyBiocFileCache/), [BioC](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocFileCache)): File system based cache for resources & metadata. 

**This book will focus on end user tutorials as develop more packages and integrations.**
